## About This Repository

This repository is a curated collection of projects developed throughout my academic career at university. The projects illustrate my capability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, explore new technologies, and build working software solutions.

Each project focuses on a specific topic or concept, such as:

- Network communication and protocols  
- Distributed task management  
- Web development and user interfaces  
- File handling and editors  
- E-commerce and utility applications

All projects come with relevant source code, documentation, and instructions to help users and collaborators understand and run them efficiently.

## Technologies & Tools

Throughout these projects, I have worked with a variety of technologies including but not limited to:

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS  
- Frameworks & Libraries: Flask, React, Dask (distributed computing), and others  
- Tools: Git & GitHub, Docker, Linux terminal commands  
- APIs & Services: Various REST APIs, cloud services  
- Databases: SQLite, MongoDB, or others where applicable

This diverse stack reflects my versatility and eagerness to learn new tools to solve problems effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository:

1. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nuriddinovN/university_projects.git
````

2. Navigate into the project directory of interest:

   ```bash
   cd university_projects/<project-folder>
   ```
3. Read the README file inside that project folder for specific setup and usage instructions.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

Throughout my work, I strive to maintain:

* Clean, readable, and well-commented code
* Consistent formatting following language-specific conventions
* Use of version control with detailed commit messages
* Modularity to promote code reuse and easier maintenance
* Testing wherever possible to ensure reliability

---

## How to Use This Repository

* Browse through the project folders to explore different domains and challenges I have worked on.
* Each project is independent, so you can clone or copy only what interests you.
* Feel free to fork or clone the whole repository if you want to experiment with multiple projects.
* Pull requests, feedback, and suggestions are welcome for improvements or collaborations.

---

## Project Structure

Each project folder generally contains:

* Source code files (.py, .js, .cpp, etc.)
* A README.md explaining the project goals, features, installation, and usage
* Sample data files or resources if needed
* Test scripts or notebooks where applicable

Example structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── helper.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
└── data/
    └── sample_input.txt
```

## Learning & Growth

This collection showcases my continuous learning process:

* Applying classroom concepts in practical settings
* Experimenting with new programming paradigms and technologies
* Gaining proficiency in debugging, testing, and deployment
* Collaborating in team environments (where applicable)
* Improving problem-solving skills and technical communication

---

## Challenges & Solutions

Every project presented unique challenges such as:

* Handling concurrency and synchronization in distributed tasks
* Optimizing performance for network communications
* Designing intuitive user interfaces and improving user experience
* Managing data integrity and persistence
* Learning and integrating unfamiliar libraries and tools

Facing these challenges helped me grow as a developer and engineer, and I document these learnings where relevant inside each project.
